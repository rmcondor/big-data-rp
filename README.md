The objective of our research proposal is to predict instances of sexual and physical violence within households. This study holds particular relevance, especially within a context characterized by elevated rates of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), as observed in the case of Mexico. To achieve this goal, we employ data from the Encuesta Nacional sobre la Dinámica de las Relaciones en los Hogares (ENDIREH), a nationally representative survey. Our approach involves the utilization of a diverse set of variables encompassing demographics, cultural practices, gender roles, and beliefs associated with empowerment, thereby facilitating the forecasting of IPV occurrences. This comprehensive methodology ensures a nuanced examination of the multifaceted factors contributing to intimate partner violence within households.
